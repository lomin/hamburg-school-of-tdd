        <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
        <p scope="col">Test-driven development is designed to provide feedback at intervals of seconds or minutes on
          whether current software development is making progress in the right direction. If the development takes too
          long until all tests can be run again without errors, this feedback is missing and a slower development speed
          is the result. We often notice that many developers are still able to handle the first two or three TDD cycles
          smoothly, but the subsequent cycles are so slow that one can hardly speak of test-driven development. We have
          therefore developed a systematic approach that leads to continuous progress in short TDD cycles. Following the
          two well-known TDD approaches - "Chicago school" and "London school" - we have named this approach St. Pauli
          school of TDD.</p>

          <p>
            We start with a new <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> project. We choose Clojure, because it has
            minimal syntax and has a high
            signal-vs-noise-ratio. It is also very readable once you are familiar with <code>f(x)</code> is written
            <code>(f x)</code>.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-00_36">00:36</h4>
          <p>
            We enter the first TDD cycle with a failing (red) test, that has been auto-generated by the Clojure build
            tool. We are therefore in the red state.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-00_40">00:40</h4>
          <p>
            To get as quickly as possible into the green state, we assert that <code>0</code> is indeed <code>0</code>.
            This is not very useful,
            but we are just warming up.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-00_59">00:59</h4>
          <p>
            The first step of the St. Pauli school of TDD is to start with a simple API test. So we change the test's
            name and specify the API of the <code>diamond</code> function. We already made some design decisions there:
            The input of
            the function should be a single character, the output should be a vector containing a string for each line
            and the function name should be "diamond". Since a function with this name does not exist yet, The test
            runner prints an error and we are back in the red state.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-01_10">01:10</h4>
          <p>
            To make some progress towards the green state, we write a minimal implementation of the <code>diamond</code>
            function.
            The <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/macros">macro</a> (a special kind of function) <a
              href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/defn"><code>defn</code></a> creates a new function with the
            name specified by the first
            argument to <code>defn</code> (here: <code>diamond</code>). The second argument to <code>defn</code> is a
            vector of all the arguments of the
            function. There is only one argument of the <code>diamond</code> function and it is named
            <code>$char</code>. The <code>$</code> sign has no
            special meaning, we just use it to prefix the variable name since there is already a <code>char</code>
            function provided
            by Clojure. Since the <code>diamond</code> function does not return anything, we are still in the red state,
            but now the
            test result is much more helpful:
            <code>expected: (= ["a"] (diamond \a)), actual: (not (= ["a"] nil))</code><br>
            That means, <code>(diamond \a)</code> should return <code>["a"]</code>, but it returns <code>nil</code>, and
            <code>nil</code> is not <code>["a"]</code>.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-01_13">01:13</h4>
          <p>
            The quickest way to get back in the green state is to return the expected value <code>["a"]</code>. This is
            both part of
            the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FakeIt">Fake-it</a>- and the
            <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?TriangulateToDesign">Triangulate</a>-Pattern. If we refactor the constant value
            to the
            real implementation, we would have used the Fake-it-pattern. But this would be
            a too big step at this point. That is why we continue with the
            Triangulate-pattern. With this pattern, we add more tests until
            returning hard coded answers gets ridiculous and the real implementation gets more obvious.

            The macro <code>cond</code> is similar to a switch statement in in other languages. Depending on the
            variable <code>$char</code>, it
            returns different hard-coded vectors. There are now three tests and a structure is emerging. That is why we
            continue with the second part of the "Fake-It" Pattern and refactor the hard coded pard in small steps
            towards the real implementation.

            We replace the hard-coded vector <code>["__a__" "_b_b_" "c___c" "_b_b_" "__a__"]</code> with the result of
            <code>(into ["__a__""_b_b_" "c___c" "_b_b_" "__a__"])</code>. Since <a
              href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/into"><code>into</code></a>
            called with only one argument returns that same argument, this change qualifies as a refactoring, because
            the internal structure of diamond has been changed but the visible result is the same.

            <code>into</code> can also be called with two collections as arguments. In that case, into returns the first
            collection
            with all elements of the second collection included. We take the next tiny step and call into with the same
            vector and an empty vector. Unsurprisingly, this does also not change the result, but is a little bit closer
            to the real implementation.

            Here, we split the first vector in two parts and call <code>into</code> with them. We are still in the green
            state, but
            now we can see a possibility to reduce the problem. The second vector can be derived from the first vector
            if we remove the first vector’s last element and reverse it afterwards.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-03_38">03:38</h4>
          <p>
            Both vectors are still independent from each other, but we already remove the last element of the second
            vector via <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/pop"><code>pop</code></a> without breaking any
            tests by adding a neutral element at the end. Except for the fact that it gets removed, this element can be
            ignored (hence the name).
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-03_54">03:54</h4>
          <p>
            At this point, to introduce the reversing of the second vector in a non-breaking way, we need to switch the
            first and the second element of the second vector before surrounding it with the <a
              href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reverse"><code>reverse</code></a> function.

            With the <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/let"><code>let</code></a> macro we are able to define
            local variables. We call it <code>$pyramid</code>, because the shape of the
            vector we assign to the variable looks like a pyramid. At first, we just define the variable without using
            it anywhere. With all this small steps we can be pretty sure to stay on the "green-path".

          <h4 id="comment-04_32">04:32</h4>

            Here we paste a prepared <code>todo</code> function into the project. The <code>todo</code> function can be

            arguments (marked by the <code>&</code> sign), which can be accessed within the function body as a list
            called <code>args</code>. The
            <code>todo</code> function will always return the last argument.

          <p>
            We delegate the responsibility of the subproblem to construct a pyramid to a function called
            <code>pyramid</code>, that
            does not exist yet, but that we would like to have. We wrap it within the <code>todo</code> function, where
            we state what
            the pyramid function would return. Since we are not sure yet with which arguments we should call this new
            function, we just call it here with the single argument <code>:todo</code>. This name signals to us, that we
            have to come
            back here later and make a decision. We can be sure, that writing tests for pyramid first will guide us to
            come up with a good API for that function.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-05_59">05:59</h4>
          <p>
            The St. Pauli school of TDD defines a recursive approach. The <code>pyramid</code> function is now the new
            SUT and we
            start again with a most basic API-test. We deliberately chose a different test input than in the
            <code>diamond</code>
            context to not overfit the design of the <code>pyramid</code> function of its usage in the
            <code>diamond</code> context. We decide
            that the <code>pyramid</code> function should have a start and an end parameter. The top of the resulting
            pyramid should
            be the defined by the <code>start</code> argument and the base of the pyramid by the <code>end</code>
            argument. The height and width
            of the pyramid can then be calculated by the distance between the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>
            argument. Since the <code>pyramid</code>
            function does not yet exist, we are now in the red state.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-06_10">06:10</h4>
          <p>
            Similar to the <code>diamond</code> function, we only implement the function signature without returning
            anything to get
            clear feedback what the test is expecting and what is still missing. Then we continue with the triangulate
            pattern to get back in the green state and learn more about the behaviour of the <code>pyramid</code>
            function.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-07_45">07:45</h4>
          <p>
            Again, three test are sufficient to notice a pattern. If the distance between the <code>start</code> and the
            <code>end</code> argument increases by one, one more argument is appended to the vector and all existing
            arguments are surrounded by
            one more underscore character. For example, given a pyramid with three lines, the top line has two
            underscores at the front and two at the back, the middle line has one underscore at the front and one at the
            back and the bottom line has no underscores at the front or at the back. If we start constructing the
            pyramid with the top line and surround each line of the pyramid with underscores when we add another line to
            the pyramid, we create this distinguished shape. How can we iteratively construct the pyramid then? First we
            need to know, how to append an element to a vector in Clojure. This is accomplished with <a
              href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/conj"><code>conj</code></a>:
            <code>(conj [] 1)</code> results in <code>[1]</code>. To add multiple lines to a vector we can use the <a
              href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduce"><code>reduce</code></a>
            function: The result of <code>(reduce + 0 [1 2 3])</code> is <code>6</code> and the result of
            <code>(reduce conj [] [1 2 3])</code> is <code>[1 2 3])</code>.
            That means, exchanging the vector <code>["__x__" "_y_y_" "z___z"]</code> with
            <code>(reduce conj []["__x__" "_y_y_" "z___z"])</code> is getting us closer to the real
            iterative construction of the pyramid without changing the behaviour of the <code>pyramid</code> function.
            In this way,
            we are both making progress and stay in the green state.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-08_25">08:25</h4>
          <p>
            Instead of calling reduce with the conj function directly, we introduce now an indirection and call reduce
            with a function, that delegates to the conj function. Still, no change of visible behaviour and still in the
            green state.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-08_31">08:31</h4>
          <p>
            In line 18, we map over each line in pyramid and call the identity function, which returns exactly the
            argument that it was called with: (mapv identity [1 2 3]) returns [1 2 3] and (mapv identity ["a" "b"])
            returns ["a" "b"]) We use the function mapv instead of the map function, because a pyramid is a vector and
            mapv returns a vector (map returns a sequence).
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-08_42">08:42</h4>
          <p>
            To prepare for the underscore-surrounding logic, the next little step is to inline the identity function
            (the parameter name p does not fit well, though: Because a pyramid consists of lines, the parameter name
            line or l to avoid a name clash would have been better).
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-08_53">08:53</h4>
          <p>
            The str function converts any value to a string. We are only mapping over strings, so the strings stay the
            same. To illustrate: (mapv str ["a" "b"]) returns ["a" "b"] and (mapv str [1 2 3]) returns ["1" "2" "3"].
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-09_06">09:06</h4>
          <p>
            Now we implement the first half of the surrounding logic by only adding an underscore to the front of the
            line l and removing all underscores in front of the strings we are mapping over. To do that, we use the
            str-function. It can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments and returns a concatenation of the
            string representation of all these arguments.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-09_17">09:17</h4>
          <p>
            To complete the underscore-surrounding logic, we do the same with the underscores at the back.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-09_24">09:24</h4>
          <p>
            We make the underscore-surrounding logic explicit by extracting a function for it.

          <h4 id="comment-09_53">09:53</h4>
          <p>
            At this point we notice, that the vector at line 23 that we are reducing over consists of the middle-lines
            of (diamond \x), (diamond \y) and (diamond \z), given that the first letter of the alphabet would be \x.
            That means, if we had a function middle-line that we could pass a character and that would return the
            corresponding middle-line, our <code>pyramid</code> function would be close to completion. So we use the
            todo function to
            formulate our wish for a middle-line function.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-10_41">10:41</h4>
          <p>
            After writing down how to use the middle-line function, it gets obvious that the API of middle-line is
            flawed. If (map middle-line [\x \y \z]) should result in ["x" "y_y" "z___z"], then that would also mean that
            (middle-line \x) should result in "x", while (middle-line \y) should result in "y_y". Given only one
            character as an argument, how should middle-line decide, how many underscores it should return? We also have
            to pass the information, which character is supposed to be the first character of the alphabet, which is the
            second character and so on. That is why we change the api of middle-line to pass it the character as well as
            its index within an arbitrary alphabet. We call this sequence an indexed-alphabet.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-10_56">10:56</h4>
          <p>
            Instead of hard-coding the indexed-alphabet, we can generate it from the start and the end parameter of the
            <code>pyramid</code> function. We formulate our wish for an indexed-alphabet function and start a new cycle
            by making the
            indexed-alphabet function our new SUT.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-11_10">11:10</h4>
          <p>
            Again, the first step in a new cycle according to the St. Pauli school of TDD is to write a simple test at
            the API-level of the SUT before implementing the SUT. But this time we made a mistake by naming the test
            identical to the SUT, which results in an error at 11:33
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-11_33">11:33</h4>
          <p>
            The SUT does not yet exist so we an expect an error. The next step is to write the definition of the SUT. We
            expect to get rid of the error and get an assertion failure instead.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-11_43">11:43</h4>
          <p>
            Because of the identical naming of the SUT and its test, the error does not disappear. Since we were
            progressing with baby steps, we are faster by going back in time when we were in the green state and redo
            the last step, instead of wondering or debugging, what we did wrong. In this way, we minimise the time in
            the red state.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-11_52">11:52</h4>
          <p>
            This time, we are naming the test correctly.

          <h4 id="comment-12_19">12:19</h4>
          <p>
            We are now getting the expected assertion failure, because we have not implemented indexed-alphabet, yet.
            Therefore, we continue with the familiar triangulate-pattern.

          <p>
            vector is a function that can be called with arbitrary arguments and returns a vector containing all the
            arguments. map-indexed is a function similar to map, except that it calls the mapping function with 0 and
            the first element of the mapped collection, 1 and the second element, etc. By combining both map-indexed and
            vector, we can replace the hard-coded [[0 \x][1 \y][2 \z]] with (map-indexed vector [\x \y \z]).

          <h4 id="comment-14_07">14:07</h4>
          <p>
            The next step is to replace [\x \y \z] with something, that generates a character sequence beginning with
            the start parameter, ending with the end parameter and all the necessary characters in between. In Clojure,
            we can generate ranges of integers easily with (range start end). For example, (range 4 7) returns (4 5 6).
            But range does not work with characters, that is why we prepare to convert a range of integers to a range of
            characters. The first tiny step is to introduce the mapping by mapping over the hard-coded vector with
            identity as the mapping function. As we used this technique before, we know that this refactoring is safe
            and we will stay in the green state.

            The char function converts an integer to a character and the int function converts a character to an int. So
            we are changing the vector of chars to a vector of ints and map over it with the char function. Applying
            both changes effectively compensate each other. The result is the exact same sequence as before and all
            tests sill pass.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-14_35">14:35</h4>
          <p>
            With all the transformation in place, we can now replace the vector with a call to range, which only needs
            the start and the end, not any elements in the middle.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-14_49">14:49</h4>
          <p>
            In contrast to our expectation, the test fails and informs us, that [[0 \x] [1 \y] [2 \z]] is not equal to
            [[0 \x] [1 \y]]. We made an off-by-one-error apparently.

            (range start end) creates a sequence including start, but excluding end. So to include end in our sequence,

          <h4 id="comment-14_53">14:53</h4>

            The definition of the middle-line function makes use of destructuring. This is a technique to assign names
            to elements of a collection parameter. As formulated in the tests, the API of the middle-line function
            expects a vector as the single argument, representing one element of an indexed alphabet. The first element
            of that vector is the index within the alphabet, so we assign the name index to that element. The second
            element is the actual character which we assign the name $char (again, the prefix $ is just there to avoid a
            name collision with the function char).

            After three examples we see that all middle lines for characters with an index larger 0 have a similar
            structure. We do not think that any additional examples would lead to any more insight. Instead we notice,
            that the middle line string consists of three parts: For all characters with an index larger than 0, the
            first and the last part are always the same and only the middle part changes dynamically depending on the
            input. Hence we use tiny baby-steps to split the string in three parts.

            but with the $char parameter instead. Since our surround function can only surround values with underscores,
            we enhance it so that it can surround a value with arbitrary values. We do not write a test for that
            enhancement because we feel confident that we can simply write the correct implementation in short time.
            This approach is called "Obvious Implementation". As a rule of thumb, we only use this pattern when writing
            the real implementation is faster than an average TDD cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we dedicate to the dynamic part of the middle line. We notice a pattern in how the middle-line is
            created depending on the arguments. If the index is 0, the middle-line is simple the character. If the index
            is 1, one underscore is surrounded by zero additional underscores and the input character. If the index is
            2, one underscore is surrounded by underscores once and the input character. If the index is 3, one
            underscore is surrounded by underscores twice and the input character. The else-case describes to this point
            only the behaviour when index is 2. That means, if we surround an underscore with underscores once, we get
            the same result as the hard-coded "___" string.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-19_18">19:18</h4>
          <p>
            At this point we introduce two more functions. first takes a collection as argument and returns the first
            element of that collection: (first [3 4 5]) returns 3. An alternative to first is to use the nth function
            and call it with the collection and the index of 0: (nth [3 4 5] 0) return 3. iterate takes a mapping
            function and an initial value and returns an infinite sequence that starts with the initial value and whose
            consecutive values are the mapping function applied to the previous element of the sequence: (first (iterate
            inc 0)) returns 0 and (nth (iterate inc 50) 3) returns 53. Since (first (iterate surround "_")) returns "_",
            we can replace the hard-coded string with this expression without changing any visible behaviour.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-19_29">19:29</h4>
          <p>
            In line 34, we reference the surround-function three times: The first call is to surround the underscores
            with the input character. This is different to the next two references of the surround functions. These are
            called to generate the underscore string with variable length. We notice that we can remove the duplication
            of calling surround twice by replacing (surround (first (iterate surround "_"))) with (second (iterate
            surround "_")) which is equivalent to (nth (iterate surround "_") 1)
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-19_57">19:57</h4>
          <p>
            We also notice, that the nth element is dependent on the index of the input character. We can replace the
            hard-coded 1 with decrementing the index by 1 via the built-in dec-function.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-20_08">20:08</h4>
          <p>
            Now it is time to remove the hard-coded "x" with the input character.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-20_14">20:14</h4>
          <p>
            After that, our else-case can also handle the case when the index equals 1, so we can delete line 33.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-20_19">20:19</h4>
          <p>
            We can replace the last hard-coded value in line 32 with the input character converted to a string.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-20_28">20:28</h4>
          <p>
            The branching can be simplified by replacing the cond-macro with a simple if.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-20_36">20:36</h4>
          <p>
            The condition can also be simplified by only checking whether the index is positive.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-21_09">21:09</h4>
          <p>
            We finish the current St. Pauli TDD cycle for middle-line by adding a validation test.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-21_28">21:28</h4>
          <p>
            Because we successfully finished the last SUT, we search for references of "todo" to check if we can resolve
            now the todo and delegate to the real implementation. We find two references: In line 72 we wrap the call to
            the pyramid-function with the todo-function. We cannot resolve this reference, because pyramid itself is
            also using the todo-function. Even if we forgot, that the St. Pauli TDD cycle for the pyramid-function is
            not completed, we would know by now. The second reference is at line 50. Because both middle-line and
            indexed-alphabet have completed their St. Pauli TDD cycle, we can replace the todo-wrapper and just call the
            real implementation.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-21_55">21:55</h4>
          <p>
            Now the else-case in line 47 can also handle all other cases so we can remove line 45 and line 46. As soon
            as there is no branching anymore, we can remove the cond-macro altogether.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-22_07">22:07</h4>
          <p>
            In hindsight, this refactoring was questionable, because the parameter name "line" does no longer fit. In
            line 46 we are now calling (middle-line line). This does not make sense, because the middle-line expects to
            be called with a pair of index and character and not with a line.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-22_29">22:29</h4>
          <p>
            After adding a validation test, we can now finish the current St. Pauli TDD cycle for the
            <code>pyramid</code> function.
            Again, we make sure that the test data is as different as possible to the previous test data.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-23_25">23:25</h4>
          <p>
            Now we can remove the last todo-reference. Thanks to our tests, we know at this point how to call the
            <code>pyramid</code> function. One could argue that we violated YAGNI since our <code>diamond</code>
            function always starts with the
            \a character but the <code>pyramid</code> function is able to generate pyramids that start with arbitrary
            characters. On
            the other hand, this design reveals on the highest abstraction level that the diamonds always start with
            the <code>\a</code> character. If we formulated this restriction within the <code>pyramid</code> function,
            it would have been buried
            one abstraction level deeper in the code. One could also argue with the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>:
            If
            we change the starting character of a diamond to a capital <code>A</code>, not only the
            <code>diamonds-tests</code> would break but
            also the <code>pyramid-tests</code>. There are more arguments whether one design is better than the other,
            but in
            conclusion, both decisions would be ok.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-23_46">23:46</h4>
          <p>
            Now our else-case can also handle all other cases, so we can remove the cond-macro.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-24_01">24:01</h4>
          <p>
            Approaching the end of the kata, we group test and production code together.
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-24_55">24:55</h4>
          <p>
            All tests pass. We do not need the todo-function anymore so we remove it. Congratulations, we completed the
            Diamond-Kata!
          </p>
          <h4 id="comment-24_25">24:25</h4>
          <p>
            Now we complete the final St. Pauli TDD cycle and make sure we really completed the kata by adding the final
            validation test at the API-level.
